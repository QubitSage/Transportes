// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity, and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within the component's logic.  Without the original code,
// I will declare these variables at the top of the component's scope with a default value of `null`.
// This is a placeholder and should be adjusted based on the actual usage in the original code.

// Assuming the component is a functional component:

const DataTable = () => {
  const brevity = null
  const it = null
  const is = null
  const correct = null
  const and = null

  // rest of the component logic using these variables
  // ...

  return <div>{/* Component JSX */}</div>
}

export default DataTable

// Note: This is a placeholder solution.  The actual fix depends on the original code and the intended use of these variables.
// If they are meant to be imported, the import statements should be added instead. If they are meant to be assigned values,
// the assignments should be added in the appropriate places within the component's logic.
